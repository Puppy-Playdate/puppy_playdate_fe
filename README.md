## Puppy Playdate 

Does your dog seem bored? Are you curious about any dog park meet ups or social events near you? Puppy Playdate is designed to meet the need for dog socialization, allowing users to connect with nearby dogs for playdates, ensuring their pets enjoy regular and enriching social interactions. The app uses geolocation so you can peak at a map and see just how close your dogs new best friend might be. You can host a doggy meet up, receive invites to them, schedule a 1 on 1 meet up and more.
